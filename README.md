# CNCF End User Community

CNCF offers multiple opportunities for **End Users** to contribute and have
their voices heard. Companies that use cloud-native technologies internally, but
do not sell any cloud-native services externally, are eligible to join the End
User Community.

The community collaborates via:
* [The cncf/enduser private repo, including SIGs](https://github.com/cncf/enduser)
* [The mailing list](https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-enduser/topics)
* [#enduser channel on the CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io/)

If your organization is already a member of the [End User Community](https://www.cncf.io/people/end-user-community/), you can [request access here](https://github.com/cncf/enduser-public/issues/new?assignees=oicheryl&labels=&template=access-end-user-community.md&title=Request+access+for+%5BORGANIZATION+NAME%5D) or email twaggoner@linuxfoundation.org.
